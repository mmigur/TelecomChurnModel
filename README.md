# Description
In this project, I used the main libraries for data analysis and machine learning:
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org)
* [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)

In the NoteBook folder, I created a .ipynb format file where I analyzed the data set, and also visualized the results of the model.

In this work, I will predict customer churn based on available data. 

P.s: The dataset is taken from the [open course on machine learning](https://mlcourse.ai/book/index.html) from the ODS platform.


# Installation and launch of the project 
* First we need to install the python interpreter from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the console and enter the commands to install the libraries there:
  * *pip install pandas*
  * *pip install numpy*
  * *pip install sciki-learn*

### Launch in CMD
* Go to script folder, write in the terminal command: python/python3 main.py
